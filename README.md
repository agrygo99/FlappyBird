# FlappyBird

CONTROLS:

Press the space bar to "flap" your Flappy Bird.  You want to get your bird to fly between two columns to score points.  If you bump into the column or hit the ground you will get a "Game over" screen with instructions on how to continue. You may press the "New Game" button or the space bar to start a new game and play again.  Pressing the Reset Button will also start a new game and reset the points for your "Score" and "High Score."  When you start a new game or reset, the user can also see a timer in the bottom left corner of their screen showing how long they have survived for, which will stop as soon as they crash.  

SOUNDS:

When you press the space bar to flap, a flapping sound will be produced. There will also be a ding when you successfully earn a point.  And if you run into a column or the ground, their will be a thumping sound indicating you crashed and the game is over.

ACCESSIBILITY:

The text and game features have been enlarged for easier visability and game play.  The sounds included also act as an auditory indication to the user of their actions by flapping, earning points, or dying.  We were trying to include another collision that the user could not see that would produce a sound command indicating if the user should flap or fall to avoid a collision with the columns.  Another idea we had, if this was a game for mobile use, is the inclusion of vibrations.  As you flapped a short vibration could be given off and if you collided/died a patterned vibration could go off as well.  That way the user could feel different features rather than just having to see or hear them.
